'''
Create a program that analyses temperature data collected from multiple weather 
stations in Australia. The data is stored in multiple CSV files under a "temperatures" 
folder, with each file representing data from one year. Process ALL .csv files in the 
temperatures folder. Ignore missing temperature values (NaN) in calculations. 

Main Functions to Implement: 

    Seasonal Average: Calculate the average temperature for each season across ALL 
    stations and ALL years. Save the results to "average_temp.txt". 
        • Use Australian seasons: Summer (Dec-Feb), Autumn (Mar-May), Winter (Jun
        Aug), Spring (Sep-Nov) 
        • Output format example: "Summer: 28.5°C" 
    
    Temperature Range: Find the station(s) with the largest temperature range (difference 
    between the highest and lowest temperature ever recorded at that station). Save the 
    results to "largest_temp_range_station.txt". 
        • Output format example: "Station ABC: Range 45.2°C (Max: 48.3°C, Min: 3.1°C)" 
        • If multiple stations tie, list all of them 
    Temperature Stability: Find which station(s) have the most stable temperatures 
    (smallest standard deviation) and which have the most variable temperatures (largest 
    standard deviation). Save the results to "temperature_stability_stations.txt". 

• Output format example:  
o "Most Stable: Station XYZ: StdDev 2.3°C" 
o "Most Variable: Station DEF: StdDev 12.8°C" 
• If multiple stations tie, list all of them
